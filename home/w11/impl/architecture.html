<h2 id="h_microarchitecture">The w11a microarchitecture</h2>
<p>
The microarchitecture of the w11a core is similar to the original 11/70 
processor, the KB11-C CPU. Little parallelism and pipelining, just prefetch 
of the next instruction, and even that only when the current instruction is 
register destination. The goal was '<i>to get it working</i>'.
The w11a core 
(see <a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/w11a/pdp11_core.vhd">pdp11_core.vhd</a>) 
is composed of four main units:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>instruction decoder
    (see <a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/w11a/pdp11_decode.vhd">
      pdp11_decode.vhd</a>),</li>
  <li>sequencer 
    (see <a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/w11a/pdp11_sequencer.vhd">
      pdp11_sequencer.vhd</a>),</li>
  <li>data path
    (see <a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/w11a/pdp11_dpath.vhd">
      pdp11_dpath.vhd</a>),</li>
  <li>MMU and the external bus and memory interface control
    (see <a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/w11a/pdp11_vmbox.vhd">
      pdp11_vmbox.vhd</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
The main difference to the KB11-C is that the w11a is not a microcoded design
but based on a large sequencer state machine with currently 113 states and
584 transitions. The number of states is significantly smaller than in the
original 11/70 for two reasons: the FPP interface isn't implemented yet and 
the bus interface and memory handling is factored out into a separate vmbox 
state machine.
The w11a main sequencer state flow graph is shown in 
<a href="#Fig_I-1">Figure I-1</a> (also as 
<a href="/downloads/w11/pictures/wfjm-w11a_seq_flow_rev569.svg">svg</a>
and 
<a href="/downloads/w11/pictures/wfjm-w11a_seq_flow_rev569_a4wrap.pdf">pdf</a>).
The symbols and color code used in this flow chart is explained in the
document 
<a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/doc/w11a_seq_flow.md">w11a_seq_flow.md</a>.
</p>

<p>
The strict separation of the main state machine and data path helped a lot
to control the logic path length. A large number of control signals
between these entities were packed into VHDL records 
(see definitions in 
<a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/w11a/pdp11.vhd">pdp11.vhd</a>)
so the port lists stayed at a reasonable length.
</p>

<h2 id="h_ibus">The Internal Bus - ibus</h2>
<p>
A very simple bus structure called <b>ibus</b> is used to connect the
CPU with control registers within the processor, e.g. in the MMU, and the
peripherals. The ibus is a simple synchronous single master - multiple slave 
bus. The control signals support the bus cycle types 
of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unibus">UNIBUS</a>. To support
the I/O emulation and the debug interface additional access modifiers 
were added to distinguish between 'CPU', 'console', and 'remote access' cycles.
The ibus (see definitions in 
<a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/ibus/iblib.vhd">iblib.vhd</a>)
is implemented with two VHDL records, a master request and a slave response,
giving very compact port maps. The slave responses are simply or'ed.
The handling of an interrupt request and acknowledge is done with separate
signals, the interrupt line to vector/priority mapping is done by an
arbiter module (see <a
href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/ibus/ib_intmap.vhd">ib_intmap.vhd</a>).
A system has one ibus per processor core, a multi-core system will have
multiple ibus'es, like the PDP-11/74 had a UNIBUS associated with each 
processor.
</p>

<h2 id="rbus">The Remote Register Interface - rbus and rlink</h2>
<p>
A second very simple bus structure called <b>rbus</b> is used to connect the
main components of a system to an external control entity. The rbus is again a
simple synchronous single master - multiple slave bus with an implementation
quite similar to the ibus (see definitions in 
<a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/vlib/rbus/rblib.vhd">rblib.vhd</a>).
Via a rbus to w11a core 'control port' interface (see 
<a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/w11a/pdp11_core_rbus.vhd">
  pdp11_core_rbus.vhd</a>)
the rbus master can control the CPU (start, stop, step etc) and access all
processor and devices registers as well as the main memory. 
This interface provides also a 32 words rbus to ibus or <b>rb2ib</b> window
which maps a fixed part of the rbus address space into a selectable part of
the ibus address space. ibus accesses via this window are marked as
'remote' accesses (via the racc signal) and can be distinguished from
CPU-originated accesses. This is used to implement the I/O system emulation.
</p>

<p>
A single rbus can handle up to four CPUs with their attached peripherals 
plus additional auxiliary units like the 'human I/O interceptor' used on 
the Digilent boards
(see <a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/bplib/bpgen/sn_humanio_rbus.vhd">
    sn_humanio_rbus.vhd</a>).
The rbus has a simple interrupt mechanism. A slave can ask for 'attention' by
asserting the LAM signal for a cycle (side note: LAM for 'look-at-me' is a 
retro pun on 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Automated_Measurement_and_Control">
  CAMAC</a>,
an instrumentation standard very often used with a PDP-11 in DAQ systems).
</p>

<p>
The rbus can be used to build a direct 16 bit memory-mapped interface to 
another processor. With the <b>rlink</b> protocol, the rbus can also be 
controlled via any bi-directional byte stream communication channel. 
In this case, the rlink-to-rbus bridge (see
<a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/vlib/rlink/rlink_core.vhd">rlink_core.vhd</a>)
is the local rbus master which can be remotely controlled from a
<b>backend server</b> via the communication channel. The rlink protocol
supports register reads and writes, block transfers, and a simple interrupt
handling via 'attention' messages. It is protected with a 18 bit CRC (see 
<a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/vlib/comlib/crc16.vhd">crc16.vhd</a>)
to detect transmission errors. The implementation is based on an extended symbol
space with 261 symbols, 256 to represent the states of a data byte and 5
additional symbols IDLE, SOP, EOP, NAK, and ATTN used as packet delimiters
and for other control purposes and was inspired by the usage of D- and 
K-symbols in optical link protocols. The symbol space is mapped into an
8 bit data stream with a simple escaping mechanism (see 
<a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/vlib/comlib/cdata2byte.vhd">cdata2byte.vhd</a>
and 
<a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/vlib/comlib/byte2cdata.vhd">
  byte2cdata.vhd</a>).
These 9 bit to 8 bit interface adapters provide a FIFO buffered byte-wide 
rlink interface used in all systems
(see also
<a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/vlib/rlink/rlink_core8.vhd">
  rlink_core8.vhd</a>).
</p>

<p>
In the current systems, the rlink communication is done via 
</p>
<ul>
  <li> a USB FIFO interface using the onboard
    <a href="http://www.cypress.com/products/ez-usb-fx2lp">
      Cypress FX2</a> USB controller 
    on Nexys2 and Nexys3 boards. The FPGA interface (see
    <a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/bplib/fx2lib/fx2_2fifoctl_ic.vhd">
      fx2_2fifoctl_ic.vhd</a>)
    provides two endpoints and a data transfer speed of up to 30 MByte/sec and
    a request-response rate of 4 kHz, limited by the USB 2.0 timing structure.
    The FX2 firmware supports besides data transfers to a running FPGA design
    also the configuration of the FPGA via JTAG (see
    <a href="{{site.my.w11.tree}}/tools/fx2/src">sources</a>
    and
    <a href="{{site.my.w11.tree}}/tools/fx2/bin">pre-build images</a>).
  </li>

  <li> a real or USB-emulated serial port (see
    <a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/vlib/rlink/rlink_sp1c.vhd">
      rlink_sp1c.vhd</a>).
    The UART (see
    <a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/vlib/serport/serport_uart_rx.vhd">
      serport_uart_rx.vhd</a>
    and
    <a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/vlib/serport/serport_uart_tx.vhd">
      serport_uart_tx.vhd</a>)
    supports baud rates up to 3 Mbaud. The baud rate is detected automatically
    by a BREAK + 0x80 sync character sequence (see
    <a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/vlib/serport/serport_uart_autobaud.vhd">
      serport_uart_autobaud.vhd</a>).
    With the onboard RS232 ports of the s3board and the Nexys2 boards, the
    maximal Baud rate is 460800 when a USB-RS232 adapter is directly
    connected. The rate  is limited by the RS232 transceivers. With
    onboard USB-UARTs like the
    <a href="https://www.ftdichip.com/Products/ICs/FT232R.htm">FT232R</a>
    on the Nexys3 Baud rates of 2 MBaud are possible. The
    <a href="https://www.ftdichip.com/Products/ICs/FT2232H.html">FT2232H</a>
    on Nexys4 and subsequent Digilent boards allow up to 12 MBaud.
  </li>

</ul>

<h2 id="h_io_emulation">The I/O System Emulation</h2>
<p>
All device I/O is emulated, as already described under 
<a href="/home/w11/impl/">Features</a>. 
A simple example is the transmit part
of the unbuffered <b>DL11</b> console interface 
(see <a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/ibus/ibdr_dl11.vhd">ibdr_dl11.vhd</a>).
Sending a character to the emulated console involves the following steps:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the CPU writes the character to the xbuf (transmit buffer) register of 
      the DL11.</li>
  <li>the controller logic clears the xrdy (transmit ready) bit in the
      csr (control status register) and asserts the RB_LAM signal for
      one cycle.</li>
  <li>this will set a bit in the attention mask of the rbus controller, and
      in case the mask was clear before, trigger the sending of an 'attn'
      symbol to the backend server.</li>
  <li>the backend server, upon reception of the 'attn' symbol, will
      retrieve the attention mask, determine the source (or sources) of the
      attention requests, and start the appropriate handling.</li>
  <li>for a console transmit attention the backend server will issue a
      remote read of the xbuf register via rbus and the rb2ib window.</li>
  <li>the remote read of the xbuf will return the character to the backend
      server, set the xrdy bit in the csr, and in case interrupts were
      enabled, set the interrupt request flop in the controller.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The DL11 receive logic is conceptually similar. The logic of the <b>LP11</b>
line printer interface (see 
<a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/ibus/ibdr_lp11.vhd">ibdr_lp11.vhd</a>)
and the <b>PC11</b>
paper tape reader/puncher interface (see 
<a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/ibus/ibdr_pc11.vhd">ibdr_pc11.vhd</a>)
is analogous.
</p>

<p>
For mass storage peripherals, the DMA transfers are emulated too. A simple
example is disk access of the <b>RK11</b> disk controller 
(see <a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/ibus/ibdr_rk11.vhd">ibdr_rk11.vhd</a>).
Reading a disk block from a disk image handled by the backend server to 
the w11a memory involves the following steps:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the CPU writes memory and disk address and transfer size information 
      into the appropriate RK11 controller registers (rkwc, rkba, rkda).</li>
  <li>the CPU writes the I/O function code into 'control&amp;status' register
        rkcs and sets the 'GO' bit to start the operation.</li>
  <li>the setting of the 'GO' bit will cause a RB_LAM and as described above
      the sending of an 'attn' symbol to the backend server.</li>
  <li>the device handling routine in the backend server will retrieve all
      relevant RK11 controller registers via rbus and the rb2ib window, read 
      the disk block data from the disk image file, and transfer the data 
      with rlink block transfer commands directly into the w11a memory.</li>
  <li>when all data is transferred, the backend server updates the RK11
      registers via rbus and the rb2ib window. The last step is to clear the 
      'GO' bit in the rkcs.</li>
  <li>the clear 'GO' bit concludes the I/O transaction, and in case 
      interrupts were enabled, the interrupt request flop is set in the 
      controller.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Even though conceptually straightforward, the devil is in the details.
Some of the device logic must be done in hardware to guarantee the timing 
behavior expected by the original drivers. The 'remote' semantics of
some registers is therefore sometimes not just the read/write mirror image
of the 'local' semantics, like as the DL11 case, but quite different.
For example, in the RK11 controller, a write to the maintenance register rkmr
is essentially a noop when done from the CPU but used for all kinds of 
control functions when done via rbus.
</p>

<h2 id="h_porting">Porting to other FPGA Families</h2>
<p>
So far the w11a has only been used on Xilinx Spartan-3 and Spartan-6 type
FPGAs, but it is expected that porting to other Xilinx FPGAs like Virtex-6 
or the Series-7 is easy. The only vendor-specific constructs
are the I/O buffers and the memories, both encapsulated in 
<a href="{{site.my.w11.tree}}/rtl/vlib/memlib">memlib</a>
and  
<a href="{{site.my.w11.tree}}/rtl/vlib/xlib">xlib</a>
, respectively. 
The w11a uses distributed RAMs for the general-purpose register file
(see <a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/w11a/pdp11_gpr.vhd">pdp11_gpr.vhd</a>)
the SAR/SDR register file in the MMU (see 
<a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/w11a/pdp11_mmu_sadr.vhd">
  pdp11_mmu_sadr.vhd</a>)
and small fifo's (see 
<a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/vlib/memlib/fifo_1c_dram_raw.vhd">
  fifo_1c_dram_raw.vhd</a>).
The cache implementation (see 
<a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/rtl/w11a/pdp11_cache.vhd">pdp11_cache.vhd</a>)
uses dual-ported block RAMs in "READ_FIRST" mode to implement a 'speculative
write' which can be undone in the next cycle.
