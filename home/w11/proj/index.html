<h2 id="h_systems">Running Systems</h2>
<p>
The project holds all the sources to synthesize a complete system. 
Complete configurations for several boards are currently part of the project,
the Digilent S3BOARD, Nexys2, Nexys3, Nexys4, Basys3, Arty A7, and CmodA7
boards. 
See section <a href="/home/w11/impl/#h_systems">
 Features: Complete Systems</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
So far, two UNIX systems have been successfully booted on the w11a:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>UNIX 5th edition</b>
  <li><b>2.11 BSD UNIX</b>
</ul>
<p>
See section 
  <a href="/home/w11/inst/systems.html">Systems Images</a> for details,
including links to the disk sets.
</p>

<h2 id="h_issues">Known Issues</h2>

<p>
There are some known differences between w11a and 11/70 and also known
bugs in the current w11a implementation (see 
<a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/doc/README_known_issues.md">
  README_known_issues.md</a>).
They affect the behavior in cases like fatal stack errors or certain
double faults which don't occur in the normal operation of an operating
system, and if they happen, in general lead to a crash anyway.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="{{site.my.w11.blob}}/doc/w11a_known_differences.md">
  known differences</a>
are not considered worth fixing, while the
known bugs will be addressed in future versions of the w11a core.
</p>
<p>
Given that the <b>w11a boots 2.11BSD</b> the cores are considered 
<b>'Design Done'</b> and <b>'FPGA proven'</b>. The USB-based Rlink
interface and the backend software perform very well. Given the loose ends 
listed above the project is still considered <b>'Beta'</b> quality.
