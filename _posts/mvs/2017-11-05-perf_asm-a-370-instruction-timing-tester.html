<p>
I stumbled some time ago on a page about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_(emulator)">Hercules</a>
instruction timing, didn't bookmark it properly, and failed to find it again.
</p>
<p>
I'm fully aware of
</p>
<ul>  
  <li>all the pitfalls of synthetic benchmarks</li>
  <li>that the concept of <i>instruction timing</i> is not meaningful for
    modern CPUs with multi-issue and out-of-order capabilities</li>
  <li>that <i>instruction timing</i> on an emulator is very different from what
    one might see on a real CPU</li>
</ul>

<p>
Despite all these provisos I wrote a small synthetic benchmark to
determine the 370 instruction timing. It covers most non-privileged
instructions in a total of 124 individual tests. The assembler source
and a result file are uploaded under
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/turnkey-mvs/files/perf_asm.zip">
perf_asm.zip</a>.
</p>

<p>
The job <code>perf_asm.jcl</code> runs about 2 minutes on a modern x86 CPU.
I've executed the job on a
<a href="http://wotho.ethz.ch/tk4-/">Turnkey 4- system</a> under Linux.
So the results reflect the performance of the
Hercules
version bundles with Juergen Winkelmann's TK4- distribution.
</p>

<p>
The results files <code>perf_asm.txt</code> list the test tag name 'Tnnn',
a short description of the instruction tested.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The column <code>med</code> gives the time in ns per instruction.</li>
  <li>The column <code>n-rr</code> gives the time normalized to "T100 : LR R,R",
    the fastest simple register-register instruction.</li>
  <li>The column <code>n-rx</code> gives the time normalized to "T102 : L R,m"
    which is a typical fast instruction with a single memory access.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The timing is actually measured with <code>STCK</code>, which is a 'time of day'
clock, The tests were done on an otherwise idle MVS system, and on an
otherwise idle host system. The job <code>perf_asm.jcl</code> was executed
29 times, the value shown in column 'med' are median values of these 29 runs to
have an estimate robust against outliers.
</p>

<p>
There are many obvious and expected trends and relations, but also a
few surprises (at least for me).
</p>

<p>
I consider this <b>V0.1</b> of this code, it needs further refinement and
cross-checking. I'd very much appreciate
<p>
<ul>
  <li>any comment on the test code itself</li>
  <li>any comment on the results</li>
  <li>any references to other similar tests</li>
</ul>
