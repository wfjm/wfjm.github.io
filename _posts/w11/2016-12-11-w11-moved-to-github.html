<p>
To say something nice first:
<i><a href="http://opencores.org/">OpenCores</a> is a very nice directory 
  service for open source hardware IP-cores</i>.
</p>
<p>
But the repository and project page services haven't been updated for many
years. In addition, OpenCores suffered two major breakdowns lately:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Access was instable or failed totally between about February 27th and 
    March 9th 2015.</li>
  <li>Access was instable after about October 2nd 2016. The whole service
    was finally re-located from servers in Sweden to the Amazon Cloud. After
    October 15th 2016 OpenCores was reachable again.</li>
</ul>
<p>
But the re-installed OpenCores featured the same out-dated services, 
essentially a plain subversion server with a 
<a href="http://www.websvn.info/">WebSVN</a> based viewer (in version 2.1.0
released 2008 !), a very rudimentary and restricted CMS for the project pages, 
and very little project tools.
</p>

<p>
So it was natural, and even overdue, to move from OpenCores to GitHub:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the repository was converted with 
    <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-svn"><code>git svn</code></a>,
    so all commits done at OpenCores are also visible in the git repository.
    Since the handling of file moves is quite different between svn and git
    and the commits were very coarse garnular some file history might have
    been lost.
  </li>
  <li>the project pages have been convered into Jekyll based GitHub-Pages.
    Taking the opportunity pages for the 
    <a href="https://wfjm.github.io/home/211bsd/">2.11BSD</a> and 
    <a href="https://wfjm.github.io/home/ouxr/">
      <b>O</b>ld <b>U</b>nix <b>XR</b>ef</a> activities
    were also setup, all with associated blogs.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The bottom line is easy to descibe:
</p>
<table class="indent"><tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>w11 repository:</td>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/wfjm/w11">
          https://github.com/wfjm/w11</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>w11 project pages:</td>
      <td><a href="https://wfjm.github.io/home/w11/">
          https://wfjm.github.io/home/w11/</a></td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
The <a href="http://opencores.org/project,w11">OpenCores w11</a>
project stays as 'frozen project' and entry in the IP-cores directory.
</p>

<div class="notebox">
