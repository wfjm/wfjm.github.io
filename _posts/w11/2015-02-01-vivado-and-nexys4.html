<h2>Vivado and Nexys4 -- a long journey</h2>

<h3>2013: First steps</h3>
<p>
Xilinx Series-7 and Vivado immediately caught my attention in 2013.
It was obvious that Vivado had a superior architecture and potential.
A real development environment for a change, not only an aging collection
of loosely coupled tools as in ISE. But the first tests with Vivado 2013.2
were sobering. Vivado synthesis failed with hundreds of warnings
</p>
<pre class="code">
  WARNING: [Synth 8-3848] Net nstate in 
     module/entity pdp11_sequencer does not have driver.
  .... many ....
  WARNING: [Synth 8-3848] Net ndpcntl_dsrc_sel in 
     module/entity pdp11_sequencer does not have driver.
</pre>
<p>
Vivado simply didn't understand the coding style used in the w11 project,
while ISE had no problems and happily produced bitfiles for Spartan-based
boards with the same codebase.
</p>
<p>
Vivado 2013.3 did a little better, only 137 instead of over 250 warnings,
but now timing closure failed with
</p>
<pre class="code">
  Source: IBD_MAXI.IBDR_SYS/IIST.I0/R_REGS_reg[exc_rte][0]_replica/C
  Dest:   CORE/SEQ/R_STATE_reg[0]/D
  Data Path Delay:  14.135ns  (logic 4.664ns route 9.471ns)
  Logic Levels:     23  (CARRY4=2 LUT3=1 LUT4=2 LUT5=2 LUT6=14 MUXF7=2)
</pre>
<p>
Vivado synthesis produced a very long logic path with 19 LUTs, while ISE
happily produced performing implementations with the same code base.
</p>

<h3>2014: Improvements</h3>
<p>
Vivado 2014.1 was the first version that seemed to handle the w11 code
properly, For a <code>sys_w11a_n4</code> design is Vivado was faster in
real time
</p>
<pre class="code">
  ISE 14.7
    XST              REAL 131s  CPU   63s
    map              REAL 356s  CPU  178s
    par              REAL 118s  CPU   62s
    Total            REAL 605s  CPU  303s

  Vivado 2014.1
    synth_design     REAL  95s  CPU  101s
    place_design     REAL  69s  CPU   73s
    phys_opt_design  REAL  68s  CPU   69s
    route_design     REAL  49s  CPU   64s
    Total            REAL 281s  CPU  307s
</pre>
<p>
and produced an implementation with lower resource consumption, 1097 slices
compared to ISE with 1333 slices.
</p>

<h3>2015: Nexys4 procurement</h3>
<p>
In January 2015 I procured a Nexys4 board. With Vivado 2014.4 I got within a
few days a running <code>sys_w11a_n4</code> design which booted a
2.11BSD system.
