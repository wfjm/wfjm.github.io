<h2>Nexys4 -- an Obituary</h2>

<p>
I bought a Nexys4 board in January 2015. It was my first board with a Series-7
FPGA. The initial development was done with ISE 14.7 because early Vivado
versions did not properly synthesize the VHDL coding style used in the w11
project. Vivado quickly matured, and with this, the Nexys4 board became the
main development platform for the w11 project in the last four and a half
years. See <a href="2015-02-01-vivado-and-nexys4.html">blog post</a> for the
early history.
</p>

<p>
Out of the blue, on July 20th, 2019, the Nexys4 board stopped working.
No functional changes on firmware or backend code had been done, only
lots of <a href="2019-07-21-spdx.html">SPDX comment changes</a>.
Board configuration worked, but any further rlink communication failed
after a few commands with
</p>
<pre class="code">
  -E- 18:15:48.122022 : DecodeResponse: NAK seen, code Ccrc
</pre>

<p>
Further analysis showed that the 2nd command of a chain was aborted with
a CRC NAK.  
</p>
<pre class="code">

</pre>

<p>
A <code>NAK</code> comma symbol (represented as <code>ca 6a</code>) is
sent by the rlink core when a received command can't be processed. The
following byte, the <code>NAK code</code>, encodes one of eight abort
conditions. The code <code>b8</code> means <code>ccrc abort</code>,
or in other words, that the CRC check for the command request failed.
</p>
<p>
A lot of systematic testing was done
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>tbrun</code> test benches run fine, thus no functional issues.</li>
  <li>all recent Vivado versions were tried, 2017.4, 2018.1, 2018.2,
    2018.3, 2019.1. Always the same result, thus not a synthesis issue.</li>
  <li>w11 works fine on Arty, Basys3, CmodA7 as well as Nexys3.</li>
  <li>on Nexys4 not only the <code>sys_w11a_n4</code> design fails, but
    also the <code>sys_tst_rlink_n4</code> design, also with a
    <code>NAK-ccrc</code> after a few commands.</li>
  <li>tried rlink speeds of 12, 6, 3, and 1 Mbps, always same abort at
    the command.</li>
  <li>the backend software works with all other boards, as well as in the
    behavioral simulation context, is thus very likely OK.</li>
</ul>

<p>
At this point, it was natural to ask whether the serial data path, starting
at the FTDI FT2232H, was somehow broken. The FT2232H as such seems to be OK
because the FPGA configuration, which uses one of the two channels, always
worked.
So I ran the <code>sys_tst_serloop2_n4</code> design

    make sys_tst_serloop2_n4.vconfig

    tst_serloop USB2 12000000 1 -break  -loop 10 4096
    # --&gt; all work fine !!
</pre>

<p>
After this puzzling finding, another round of testing started         
</p>
<ul>
  <li>tried the <code>sys_tst_sram_n4</code> design, it quickly fails
    with <code>ca 6a aa</code> or NAK-frame-error.</li>
  <li>tried both firmware and backend from older releases, V0.78, V0.77,
    V076 and V0.753. With V0.77 and older the <code>ti_w11</code> startup
    works. But booting an 211bsd_rk with V0.753 firmware and backend aborts
    on the first wblk command with a <code>ca 6a b1</code> or NAK-dcrc.
    And this for sure worked before.</li>
</ul>

Given all the evidence listed above all plausible error scenarios I could
come up with are somehow excluded:
<ul>
  <li>the backend software works with all other boards, as well as in the
    behavioral simulation context. Older versions, which definitely worked
    before, now also fail with some NAK code, ccrc, dcec or frame, all
    indicating that the rlink engine received corrupted data.</li>
  <li>if it's a timing error in the CRC calculation one should see
    different signatures with different Vivado versions. And again,
    older code versions, e.g. V0.753, which definitely worked, also fail.</li>
  <li>if some LUTs or FLOPs are broken in the FPGA one should again see
    different signatures with different Vivado versions and even older
    project versions due to different placements. I've had a board with an
    internal fault before, but in that case, the behavior was very sensitive
    to minor design changes.</li>
  <li>data could get clobbered between the FT2232H USB UART and the FPGA,
    but then one should see a dependence on link speed. But in this case,
    <code>sys_tst_serloop2_n4</code> should also fail, but it doesn't.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The sad bottom line is that the Nexys4 board is apparently broken. It is
quite unclear what exactly is damaged. The only thing I can do is to put
the Nexys4 board aside and buy a Nexys4 A7 as a replacement.
