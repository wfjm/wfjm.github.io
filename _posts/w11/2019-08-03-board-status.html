    board: S3BOARD
    link:  digi_s3board
    state: dormant
    comm:  My very first board, the entire initial w11 development was done
           with it. Performance of the rlink over a 460k Baud RS232 link is
           modest, enough for initial proof-of-principle studies, but somewhat
           slow for practical usage. See also

    board: Nexys2
    link:  digi_nexys2
    state: active
    comm:  The Cypress FX2 USB interface provided a real performance boost, the
           rlink concept finally worked out. Full usage of the 22 bit
           address space thanks to the easy to interface PSRAM memory.

    board: Atlys
    link:  digi_atlys
    state: unused
    comm:  The first Spartan-6 based board. However, interfacing the DDR2 memory
           was suspended when the Nexys3 arrived, and in fact, never completed.
           The Atlys board is used in other projects, but not for w11.

    board: Nexys3
    link:  digi_nexys3
    state: active
    comm:  Great Spartan-6 based board, with easy to interface PSRAM memory.
           There was also a modest increase in performance, with the w11
           system clock increasing from 50 MHz to 64 MHz. Of all my boards,
           this one has the smallest FPGA size, the current w11a design
           uses 93% of the slices. The w11 will outgrow this board soon.

    board: Nexys4
    link:  digi_nexys4
    state: broken
    comm:  The first Series-7 based board. The initial development was done
           with ISE 14.7, but quickly switched to Vivado. A much better IDE,
           code development was fun again, essentially the entire development
           was done on the Nexys4. W11 system clock increased to 80 MHz.
           The <a href="2019-07-27-nexys4-obituary.html">board broke</a>
           unfortunately in July 2019.

    board: Basys3
    link:  digi_basys3
    state: active
    comm:  Just cute. No onboard memory, so w11 sees only 176 kByte memory
           implemented with BRAMs.

    board: Arty A7
    link:  digi_arty
    state: active
    comm:  This board has the best value for money ratio of all my boards.
           It took quite some time to get the DDR3 memory interface operating,
           but since then this board has been one of the main development
           boards. Very nice is the built-in current monitor.

    board: CMod A7
    link:  digi_cmoda7
    state: active
    comm:  A real gadget, certainly the most compact setup I have. The 35T
           die size is more than enough for a w11. The 512 kByte onboard
           memory combined with some BRAMs result in 672 kByte visible to
           the w11 CPU, enough to run a trimmed down 211bsd system.

    board: Nexys A7
    link:  digi_nexysa7
    state: active
    comm:  The Arty board is nice and from a purely functional point
           everything you need. But I like the LEDs of the Nexys series
           boards, the perfect board for a <i>blinking lights</i> w11.
           So I ordered a Nexys A7 board, formerly known as Nexys4 DDR,
           to replace the broken Nexys4 <i>classic</i>.
