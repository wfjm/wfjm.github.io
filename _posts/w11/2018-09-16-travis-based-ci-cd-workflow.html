<h2>Travis based CI/CD workflow added</h2>
<h3>Initial setup (2018-09-16)</h3>
<p>
Travis offers under <code>travis-ci.org</code> a nice environment for
<code>CI/CD</code> workflows, even free of charge for open source projects,
and easy one-click integration with GitHub.
Under the given limitations of the Travis environment, like no custom
containers, as well as memory size and execution time limits, it was obvious
that neither the generation of FPGA bitfiles with ISE or Vivado nor the
generation of simulation models with GHDL (which needs Vivado/ISE UNISIM
libraries) is feasible.
The more limited goal was to verify the proper functioning of
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the backend software</li>
  <li>the test benches under <code>tbrun</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
The simulation models are built separately outside of the Travis
<code>CI/CD</code> workflow, packaged as a <i>tarball</i>, and uploaded
to a server. That must be done each time when the VHDL codebase is changed
and must be done before the code is committed to GitHub and the
<code>CI/CD</code> is workflow triggered. Not nice, but the best possible
solution given the constraints.
</p>
<p>
In September 2018 only Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) was supported by Travis and
that allowed to set up a <i>build matrix</i> with
<ul>
  <li>gcc 4.8</li>
  <li>gcc 7</li>
  <li>clang 7</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each job has the steps
</p>
<ul>
  <li>download and unpack the simulation models</li>
  <li>compile the backend software with the selected compiler</li>
  <li>execute with <code>tbrun</code> the test benches</li>
  <li>save detailed log files in a <i>deploy</i> step</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3>Ubuntu 2016.04 LTS available, extended build matrix (2019-01-04)</h3>
<p>
Finally and after much popular demand, Travis provided in January 2019 Travis
Ubuntu 2016.04 LTS (xenial). That allows extending the <i>build matrix</i> to
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ub 14.04 - gcc 4.8.4</li>
  <li>Ub 14.04 - gcc 7.4.0</li>
  <li>Ub 16.04 - clang 7.0.0</li>
  <li>Ub 16.04 - gcc 5.4.0</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note, the newest gcc is available as <i>backport</i> under Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

  <b>Note 2021-06-15:</b> 
  Travis was acquired by Idera, Inc in January 2019. Rumors said, that a
  few weeks later <i>a big portion of the old Travis team was fired</i>.
  Since June 15th, 2021, the building on <code>travis-ci.org</code> is ceased.
  No support free of charge support for open source projects anymore only
  paid services on <code>travis-ci.com</code>.
  The commit <a href="https://github.com/wfjm/w11/commit/6b8c0633">6b8c0633</a>
  removes Travis support on August 22nd, 2021.
