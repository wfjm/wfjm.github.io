, 
which boots so far RT-11, RSTS V4, BSD 2.9, and Unix V6. There was a
question of how fast an FPGA solution might be compared to a PDP-11/93.
</p>
<p>
I've also implemented a PDP-11 on an FPGA. It is a full 11/70 with
split I&amp;D, MMU, and cache. No FPP so far. Available peripherals are so
far DL11, LP11, KW11L, PC11, and RK11. All I/O is channeled over via
'remote-register-interface' onto a single bi-directional byte stream
interface, so the FPGA board needs a backend PC with a server program
to handle the I/O requests.
</p>

<p>
The design is FPGA proven, runs on Digilent S3 and NEXYS2 boards, the
former with 1 MB 10 ns SRAM, the latter with 16 MB 70ns PSDRAM.
</p>
<p>
Resource consumption is
</p>
<pre>
  S3 board      xc3s1000   2471 slices or 33%
  NEXYS2 board  xc3s1200e  2624 slices or 30%
</pre>
<p>
The implementation was verified against many XXDP maindec's. There are
some open issues, especially some details of trap and double error
handling aren't correct yet. In practice this is of little importance,
the FPGA system happily boots and runs BSD 2.11, a system using 22bit
addressing and split I&amp;D space. {Note: you need
<a href="/blogs/211bsd/2009-01-04-patch-446+447.html">patch 447 for 2.11BSD</a>
to get FPP emulation and RK support working}
</p>
<p>
On Performance: The design runs at 50 MHz. I've run parts of the
Byte Unix benchmark on the FPGA systems. Given that the FPP is only
emulated by the 2.11BSD kernel it makes only sense to look at the integer
benchmarks. The Dhrystone benchmark 'dhry2reg' gives about '11500 lps'
on both boards. For comparison see Michael Schneiders benchmark collection
which gives about '830 lps' for an 11/53. There is little Dhrystone difference
between  the two boards despite the very different memory access times. The
8 kB cache with 32 bit cache lines really helps on the NEXYS2 board.
</p>
<p>
I'm in the middle of homogenizing some internal interfaces and of some
code cleanup, also the backend handler needs a re-write in C++ (currently
Perl). When that's done I'll make the whole package (VHDL sources, test
benches, backend) available on <a href="https://opencores.org/">OpenCores</a>.

Finally a comment to Dave Mitton's remark
</p>
<blockquote>
  "Now what would be really cool would be to make
  4 CPUs and re-create an 11/74 quad."

The reason why I picked an 11/70 and not a J11 as the target is because my
goal is an 11/74. I've implemented the IIST already and tested it against
the IIST Diagnostic I could find in XXDP (riiab0).  A dual-core will
fit into a single xc3s1200e of the NEXYS2 board. The work needed is
quite clear and doable (changes on cache, mmu, and cpu core for asrb).
However, I've no plans to implement the CIS, so it will always be a
subset of an 11/74. But for sure fun to do and run.
