<h2 id="h_who">Who am I</h2>
<p>
Since secondary school, my interests are physics, electronics, and computing.
A brief (and easy to find out) CV:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>studied physics at the
    <a href="http://www.uni-koeln.de/">University of Cologne</a>,</li>
  <li>went on to <a href="https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/mpi/en/start/">
      Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics</a> in Heidelberg,</li>
  <li>earned a degree in experimental nuclear physics from
    <a href="http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/index_e.html">
      Heidelberg University</a> with an experiment conducted at
    <a href="">CERN</a> on the
    <a href="https://home.cern/about/accelerators/synchrocyclotron">
      Synchrocyclotron</a>,</li>
  <li>worked as a postdoctoral fellow at
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.gsi.de">GSI</a> in Darmstadt</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.lbl.gov">
          Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL)</a> 
        in Berkeley on experiments at the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevatron">Bevatron</a></li>
    </ul>
  <li>came back to <a href="http://www.gsi.de">GSI</a> when the
    SIS-18 accelerator upgrade started operation,</li>
  <li>and finally engaged in the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facility_for_Antiproton_and_Ion_Research">FAIR</a>
    project.
  </li>
</ul> 

<p>
Due to my interest vector <code>[physics,electronics,computing]</code> I
concentrated on the technical aspects of experiments, mainly on the
sectors of front-end electronics, data acquisition, and data analysis.
Over time I've worked with many
</p>

    </li>
</ul>

My initial contact with computers was an IBM/360 assembler course during
secondary school, and later during undergraduate times via 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card">
  punched cards</a> which were sent via
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_job_entry">
  remote job entry (RJE)</a> stations to a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer">
   mainframe computer</a>.
</p>

<p>
The first real hands-on experience was with 
DEC PDP-11
systems running under
RT-11
and
RSX-11. 
These systems were used for many years as a central element in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_acquisition">data acquisition</a>
systems, and my role was often to squeeze the last grain of performance out
of them. So I naturally learned a lot about the hardware and software stack.
The data of my Diploma Thesis was collected with a PDP-11/20. For data
analysis, we had a PDP-11/45, which also served as an RJE station for a
CDC 7600 used for theory calculations. The data for my PhD Thesis was
collected initially with a PDP-11/34 which had several
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Automated_Measurement_and_Control">CAMAC</a>
crates directly attached to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unibus">UNIBUS</a>.
The final setup was a multiprocessor system with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEC_J-11">J-11</a> based processors
(a CES ACC 2180 from CES/Geneva) in each CAMAC crate which were read out via
an MBD <em>'Micro-controlled Branch Driver</em>'
(from <a href="https://www.bira.com/about.html">BiRa</a>/Albuquerque)
which in turn was attached to the UNIBUS of a VAX-750. Bare metal MACRO-11
assembler for raw speed on the J-11's front-ends, micro-coding on the
MBD for throughput of the data transport, and all the conveniences of
VMS on the back-end VAX-750. It was really fun to develop this system.

<p>
I've started building electronics gadgets during secondary school times, 
based on very basic

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400_series">SN7400</a> series 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor%E2%80%93transistor_logic">
  TTL</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4000_series">CD4000</a> series
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS">CMOS</a>
circuits. 
Later my focus was mainly on using electronics and computers in the most 
efficient way, but on one occasion I had to manage the design and 
implementation of a quite complex electronics system, learned in-depth
to use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGAs</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processor">DSPs</a>,
and ended up writing all the FPGA firmware in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL">VHDL</a>.
</p>

<p>
In 2006 I was looking for a nice but ambitious pastime project. 
By chance, I stumbled over a box with a bunch of old DEC PDP-11 manuals.
Combined with my old affection for PDP-11's that quickly became what now
is the <a href="/home/w11/">w11 project</a>.
Quickly 
2.11BSD 
became the prime candidate for the operating system to run on my w11,
which in turn triggered my 
<a href="/home/211bsd/">2.11BSD</a>
and the
<a href="/home/ouxr/">Old Unix XRef</a>
activities.
</p>

<p>
In mid 2017 I learned that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MVS">IBM MVS</a>
releases up to 3.8j (24-bit, released in 1981)
were freely available and could be run with an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/370">IBM System/370</a>
emulator like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_(emulator)">Hercules</a>.
Operating System plus many compilers are conveniently available as a
<a href="http://wotho.ethz.ch/tk4-/">Turnkey System</a>. That quickly
brought back memories of the 70s and early 80s, and led to another
sector of retro-computing activities, the
<a href="{{site.my.mvs_lt.blob}}/README.md">
mvs38j-langtest</a> project.
Digging deeper into Hercules performance issues and the quest for the fastest
assembler code led to the
<a href="{{site.my.mvs_sp.blob}}/README.md">s370-perf</a>
project. In both projects, a large number of batch jobs must be handled, which
triggered the development of some tools, which form now the
<a href="{{site.my.mvs_ht.blob}}/README.md">
herc-tools</a> project.
